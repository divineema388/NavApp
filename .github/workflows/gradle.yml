    steps:
      # 1. Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Set up JDK 17
      - name: Set up JDK 17
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          java-version: '17'
          distribution: 'temurin'

      # 3. (Optional but good practice) Cache Gradle dependencies and wrapper
      - name: Cache Gradle packages
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: |
            ~/.gradle/caches
            ~/.gradle/wrapper
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-gradle-${{ hashFiles('**/*.gradle*', '**/gradle-wrapper.properties') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-gradle-

      # 4. THIS IS THE NEW STEP TO ADD
      - name: Grant execute permission for gradlew
        run: chmod +x ./gradlew

      # 5. Build your app (e.g., assembleDebug or assembleRelease)
      #    The error was in this step because gradlew wasn't executable
      - name: Build with Gradle (Debug) # Or whatever your build task is
        run: ./gradlew assembleDebug # Or the 'build' task if that's what you intended
        # If you were using 'build', it might be:
        # run: ./gradlew build

      # 6. Upload the generated APK as a build artifact
      - name: Upload Debug APK
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: app-debug
          path: app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
          # If you built a release APK, use:
          # name: app-release
          # path: app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
